# Boost Blitz
2D rocket launch game for CS 583


Several changes were made to my original design document. However, I implemented the gameplay and general game design, I did not end up including aliens and a currency tracker to improve the rocket, it was simply not within the scope of my time. I did, however, implement several of the other core mechanics I set out to, including the boost shielding mechanic and interaction with asteroids. The game also gets harder as time passes (the rocket moves faster with more asteroids), in addition to implementing health regeneration items that spawn randomly.
